# Laravel Defender

A modular security package for Laravel designed to help you monitor and protect your Laravel applications with tools similar to Wordfence in the WordPress ecosystem.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Currently under development**. Contributions and feedback are welcome.

> **Note:**  
> This package is 100% open source and does not connect to any external service by default.  
> In the future, an optional SaaS connector will be available as a separate package to unlock advanced features.

## ‚ú® Features (Planned)

- üõ°Ô∏è Honeypot-based spam protection for forms  
- üëÅÔ∏è Request logging and alert system for suspicious activity  
- üìù View logs and alerts via Artisan command
- ‚öôÔ∏è Customizable rules and middleware  
- üéõÔ∏è Optional Laravel Nova/Telescope integration  

---

## üöÄ Installation

_Not yet available on Packagist_

```bash
composer require metalinked/laravel-defender
```

After installation, publish the config file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=defender-config
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Honeypot Spam Protection

This package provides configurable honeypot protection for your Laravel forms.

### Quick start

1. **Publish the Blade view (optional):**
   ```bash
   php artisan vendor:publish --tag=defender-views
   ```

2. **Add the honeypot field to your forms:**
   ```blade
   @defenderHoneypot
   ```

3. **Configure automatic protection (optional):**
   In `config/defender.php`, set:
   ```php
   'honeypot' => [
       'auto_protect_forms' => true, // or false for manual middleware
       // ...other options
   ],
   ```

4. **Manual middleware (if auto protection is disabled):**
   Add the middleware to your route:
   ```php
   Route::post('/your-form', ...)->middleware('defender.honeypot');
   ```

### How it works

- The honeypot adds hidden fields to your forms via the Blade directive.
- Submissions that fill the honeypot field or submit too quickly are blocked with a 422 error.
- All options are configurable in `config/defender.php`.

## üìä Viewing IP Logs and Alerts

Laravel Defender provides an Artisan command to review access logs and suspicious activity directly from the console.  
This approach is secure and convenient, as it does not expose sensitive data via the web and works even if your app does not have a backoffice.

### Why via Artisan?

- **Security:** Only accessible from the server/CLI, not exposed to the public.
- **Simplicity:** No need to build or protect a web dashboard for basic log review.
- **Flexibility:** Easily filter, search, and export logs as needed.

### Usage

Show the latest 50 logs:
```sh
php artisan defender:ip-logs
```

Show only suspicious logs:
```sh
php artisan defender:ip-logs --suspicious
```

Filter by IP:
```sh
php artisan defender:ip-logs --ip=1.2.3.4
```

Limit the number of results:
```sh
php artisan defender:ip-logs --limit=100
```

You can combine options as needed.

---

_You can extend or export logs as needed for further analysis. A web dashboard is planned for future releases via SaaS integration._

---

## üîí Security Audit

Run a local security audit of your Laravel project:

```sh
php artisan defender:audit
```

This command checks for:
- Publicly accessible `.env` file
- APP_DEBUG enabled
- Permissive CORS configuration
- Insecure session cookies
- Laravel version

It gives clear recommendations for each issue found.

---

## üì¶ Usage

Basic usage examples will be added as the package stabilizes. Planned usage will include:

- Publishing config files  
- Using middleware and Blade components 

---

## üß™ Testing

Run tests with:

```bash
composer test
```

Or if using Pest:

```bash
./vendor/bin/pest
```

> **Note:**  
> Make sure your PHP installation has the `sqlite3` and `pdo_sqlite` extensions enabled.  
> These are required for running the package tests (Testbench uses SQLite in-memory by default).

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it via email to [security@metalinked.net](mailto:security@metalinked.net). All reports will be handled responsibly and in confidence.

---

## Usage Model

- **Freemium (offline):** All users can use the basic security features locally, without connecting to the SaaS. No registration required.
- **Freemium (SaaS-connected):** _[Planned]_ Users will optionally be able to register on the SaaS platform to monitor and manage up to 1 Laravel project for free, with centralized logs and basic dashboard.
- **Premium (SaaS-connected):** _[Planned]_ Paid plans will unlock premium features (AI risk scoring, advanced signatures, multi-project management, etc.) and/or allow monitoring more Laravel projects from the SaaS dashboard. Each project will be linked to a unique token generated in the SaaS panel.

---

## üìç Roadmap

### MVP (Freemium, Offline)
- [x] IP logging & alert manager
- [x] Honeypot spam protection
- [ ] Local notifications (mail, Slack, Telegram)
- [ ] Security audit module (env, debug, CORS, etc.)
- [ ] Privacy-friendly client fingerprinting (IP, UA, headers, timezone, etc.)

### SaaS Integration (Freemium/Premium) ‚Äî _via separate connector package_
- [ ] Basic SaaS API connection (token-based)
- [ ] Centralized SaaS dashboard (1 project free)
- [ ] Token management and activation flow

### Premium Features (SaaS only)
- [ ] Advanced attack signatures (JSON-based rule engine, regex matching)
- [ ] AI-powered risk scoring for suspicious requests
- [ ] Integration with external IP reputation services (AbuseIPDB, Project Honeypot, etc.)
- [ ] API endpoints for enterprise clients (event/alert consumption)
- [ ] Multi-project management
- [ ] Security audit module with PDF reports (correlate logs with public CVEs)

**This roadmap is inspired by expert security feedback and aims to make Laravel Defender a truly advanced, modern, and extensible security solution for Laravel and beyond.**
