## üöÄ Installation

_Not yet available on Packagist_

```bash
composer require metalinked/laravel-defender
```

After installation, publish the config file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=defender-config
```

---

## üìä Viewing IP Logs and Alerts

Laravel Defender provides an Artisan command to review access logs and suspicious activity directly from the console.  
This approach is secure and convenient, as it does not expose sensitive data via the web and works even if your app does not have a backoffice.

### Why via Artisan?

- **Security:** Only accessible from the server/CLI, not exposed to the public.
- **Simplicity:** No need to build or protect a web dashboard for basic log review.
- **Flexibility:** Easily filter, search, and export logs as needed.

### Usage

Show the latest 50 logs:
```sh
php artisan defender:ip-logs
```

Show only suspicious logs:
```sh
php artisan defender:ip-logs --suspicious
```

Filter by IP:
```sh
php artisan defender:ip-logs --ip=1.2.3.4
```

Limit the number of results:
```sh
php artisan defender:ip-logs --limit=100
```

You can combine options as needed.

---

_You can extend or export logs as needed for further analysis. A web dashboard is planned for future releases._

## üì¶ Usage

Basic usage examples will be added as the package stabilizes. Planned usage will include:

- Publishing config files  
- Using middleware and Blade components  
- Dashboard access from your app (or SaaS)

## üõ°Ô∏è Honeypot Spam Protection

This package provides configurable honeypot protection for your Laravel forms.

### Quick start

1. **Publish the config and Blade view (optional):**
   ```bash
   php artisan vendor:publish --tag=defender-config
   php artisan vendor:publish --tag=defender-views
   ```

2. **Add the honeypot field to your forms:**
   ```blade
   @defenderHoneypot
   ```

3. **Configure automatic protection (optional):**
   In `config/defender.php`, set:
   ```php
   'honeypot' => [
       'auto_protect_forms' => true, // or false for manual middleware
       // ...other options
   ],
   ```

4. **Manual middleware (if auto protection is disabled):**
   Add the middleware to your route:
   ```php
   Route::post('/your-form', ...)->middleware('defender.honeypot');
   ```

### How it works

- The honeypot adds hidden fields to your forms via the Blade directive.
- Submissions that fill the honeypot field or submit too quickly are blocked with a 422 error.
- All options are configurable in `config/defender.php`.

---

## üß™ Testing

Run tests with:

```bash
composer test
```

Or if using Pest:

```bash
./vendor/bin/pest
```

> **Note:**  
> Make sure your PHP installation has the `sqlite3` and `pdo_sqlite` extensions enabled.  
> These are required for running the package tests (Testbench uses SQLite in-memory by default).

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it via email to [security@metalinked.dev](mailto:security@metalinked.dev). All reports will be handled responsibly and in confidence.

---

## Usage Model

- **Freemium (offline):** All users can use the basic security features locally, without connecting to the SaaS. No registration required.
- **Freemium (SaaS-connected):** Users can optionally register on the SaaS platform to monitor and manage up to 1 Laravel project for free, with centralized logs and basic dashboard.
- **Premium (SaaS-connected):** Paid plans unlock premium features (AI risk scoring, advanced signatures, multi-project management, etc.) and/or allow monitoring more Laravel projects from the SaaS dashboard. Each project is linked to a unique token generated in the SaaS panel.

---

### SaaS Token Configuration

After publishing the config file, you can set your SaaS token in `config/defender.php`:

```php
'saas_token' => 'TOKEN_FROM_SAAS',
```

## üìç Roadmap

### MVP (Freemium, Offline)
- [x] IP logging & alert manager
- [x] Honeypot spam protection
- [ ] Local notifications (mail, Slack, Telegram)
- [ ] Security audit module (env, debug, CORS, etc.)
- [ ] Privacy-friendly client fingerprinting (IP, UA, headers, timezone, etc.)

### SaaS Integration (Freemium/Premium)
- [ ] Basic SaaS API connection (token-based)
- [ ] Centralized SaaS dashboard (1 project free)
- [ ] Token management and activation flow

### Premium Features (SaaS only)
- [ ] Advanced attack signatures (JSON-based rule engine, regex matching)
- [ ] AI-powered risk scoring for suspicious requests
- [ ] Integration with external IP reputation services (AbuseIPDB, Project Honeypot, etc.)
- [ ] API endpoints for enterprise clients (event/alert consumption)
- [ ] Multi-project management
- [ ] Security audit module with PDF reports (correlate logs with public CVEs)

**This roadmap is inspired by expert security feedback and aims to make Laravel Defender a truly advanced, modern, and extensible security solution for Laravel and beyond.**
